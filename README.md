Thare are 2 files in it: check.py and tweak.py and Both files are written by me.

check.py- checks the model type means if the model is of CNN or not after importing Python File(contains model) as Module. 

tweak.py- tweaks/changes the hyperparameter(no.of neurons) in every re-training of model so that accuracy of the current model can be increased.
